### **Overview**
This project introduces a **GraphQL API Gateway** designed to connect multiple microservices. By using a unified GraphQL schema, the platform reduces complexity and provides a single endpoint for querying data across multiple services, making data retrieval more efficient and flexible for client applications.

### **Key Features**

#### **1. Centralized API Gateway with GraphQL**

</p>

- **Description**: This **GraphQL API Gateway** serves as a single point of entry for querying data from multiple microservices, reducing the need for individual REST endpoints.
- **How It Works**: Instead of having clients query multiple microservices individually, the gateway unifies all data into a single GraphQL schema. Clients can request exactly the data they need in a single API call, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.

---

#### **2. Schema Stitching for Microservices**

</p>

- **Description**: Schema stitching combines multiple schemas from different microservices into one **GraphQL schema**, enabling seamless data access across distributed services.
- **How It Works**: The **Apollo Server** stitches together schemas from each microservice, allowing the gateway to present a unified schema to clients. This ensures that services can evolve independently without affecting the API structure.

#### **3. Efficient Querying and Data Fetching**

</p>

- **Description**: GraphQL allows clients to request only the specific data they need, preventing over-fetching and improving performance.
- **How It Works**: With GraphQL, clients define the structure of the response, specifying only the fields they require. The gateway fetches the necessary data from the microservices and returns a tailored response, optimizing data retrieval.

---

### **Architecture**
The system is built using **Node.js** with **Apollo Server** for GraphQL queries and schema stitching. Each microservice provides its own schema, which is combined at the gateway level. The architecture is scalable and allows services to be deployed, updated, or retired independently.

#### **Core Components**:
- **Node.js**: Manages the backend logic and performance optimization for API requests.
- **Apollo Server**: Implements the GraphQL API and performs schema stitching across microservices.
- **GraphQL Gateway**: Acts as the central point for all data queries from multiple services.

### **Challenges Solved**
- **API Complexity**: Simplified API design by providing a single GraphQL schema instead of managing multiple REST endpoints.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced data over-fetching, improving API performance by up to **30%**.
- **Scalability**: Allowed microservices to evolve independently while maintaining a unified API experience for clients.

### **Impact**
- Reduced client-side API complexity, improving data retrieval efficiency by **30%**.
- Accelerated development speed, enabling faster feature releases with independent service updates.
- Improved client performance by reducing unnecessary data fetches.
